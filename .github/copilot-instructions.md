- Alt text for all images
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3)
- Focus states for interactive elements
- ARIA labels for icon links

### GitHub Pages Deployment:
- No build process required
- All paths relative
- Include `.nojekyll` file if needed
- README with deployment instructions

## üé® Design Principles

- **Professional First**: Effects enhance, not distract
- **Clean Layout**: Whitespace, clear typography
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Important info stands out
- **Consistent**: Unified color scheme and spacing
- **Fast**: Effects are performant, no janky animations
- **Subtle Motion**: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
